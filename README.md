Programs solved as part of python training from Udemy.

First program- Decode Matrix

This program is to decode a matrix.The matrix script is a  N*M  grid of strings. It consists of alphanumeric characters, spaces and symbols (!,@,#,$,%,&).
The matrix should be decoded by reading the column from top to bottom.If there are symbols or spaces between two alphanumeric characters of the decoded script, then replace them with a single space '' for better readability.
Sample Input
7 3
Tsi
h%x
i #
sM
$a
#t%
ir!
Sample Output
This is Matrix#  %!

Second Program- Maximise it

Given a function f(x)= X**2, also given a list of k elements. maximise it gives
S=(f(x1)+f(x2)+....+f(xk))%M
Find the maximum value of S

Input Format

The first line contains 2 space separated integers  which is the no of lists to be entered and the M value
Then input the elements in the list
Sample Input
3 1000 ( 3 lists, M value is 1000)
2 5 4   (1st list contain 2 elements- 5,4)
3 7 8 9 (2nd list contain 3 elements-7,8,9)
5 5 7 8 9 10 (3rd list contain 5 elements-5,7,8,9,10)

Sample Output
206
